# Benchmarks

We've created a couple benchmarks to measure WebRx's performance in various situations vs. other popular frameworks.
These benchmarks are mostly of synthetic nature and in no way intended to claim that WebRx is "better" than the other 
participating frameworks.

- [Inserting items in the middle of a collection](https://jsperf.com/webrx-collection-binding-performance-split-insert)
